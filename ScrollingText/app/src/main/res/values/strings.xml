<string name="article_text">This is a combination of my favorite music that I listen to daily for the gym. I believe any music enthusiast will appreciate the music and the title oif the playlist is <i>Heavy Lifts</i> album. All of the music below can be found at www.itunes.com.
\n\n
The Playlist starts off with some classical rock, this mood and tone of music helps get me mentally prepared to push myself.
\n\n
<b>Highlights include:</b>
\n\n
<b><i>Bon Jovi - Living On A Prayer</i></b> -  Good classic song
\n\n
<b><i>Lenny Kravitz - Are You Gonna Go My Way </i></b> and <b><i>Fly Away</i></b> â€” A great musical talent mixed with great lyrics.
\n\n
<b><i>Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody</i></b> A national classic and if you have even seen the Bohemian Rhapsody film you will have a different appreciation for this song.
\n\n
<b><i>Listed below are the lyrics for Bohemian Rhapsody</i></b> - " Is this the real life ? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide No escape from reality Open your eyes Look up to the skies and see Im just a poor boy I need no sympathy Because Im easy come easy go Little high little low Any way the wind blows does not really matter to me, to me Mama  just killed a man Put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger now he's dead Mama life had just begun But now Ive gone and thrown it all away Mama ooh."
